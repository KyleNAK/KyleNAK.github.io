The objective was to get a tennis ball from the third floor of the building down to the second floor within a designated area. Our team designed a system to transfer the ball using tri-fold poster boards to guided the ball off the balcony of the third floor down into a duct vent. The duct vent lead to the second floor and we used a bed sheet to guide the ball into the designated area."
