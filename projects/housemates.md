summary: My team and I built a web application to assist college students in finding housing outside of campus.
---

[Housemates](https://github.com/housemates/housemates) is a Meteor application that provides the University of Hawaii community with a means to collaborate on finding off-campus housing. Users will be able sign up for an account which will then allow them to find other users that want to live in the same area as they do. This assists students who want to find housing outside of campus. When looking for future housemates, the user can filter their search by name, certain area to live, and user description. If you see someone who looks like a reasonable roommate, they can contact them through any of their contact info. 

Here is a walkthrough of the application page by page.

## Signing In/Signing Up

When users first enter the Landing Page, they get a brief overview of the features of House Mates. They can get a more detailed explanation and walkthrough with the option "How to Use House Mates", which is presented in the page's navigation bar before and after a user signs in. Users can create their own account with an email address and password, or they can sign in to an existing account. After signing up with an email and password, new users are directed to create their profile with the fields shown below:



After their profile creation, the Navigation Bar presents these features in the following order: a walkthrough of the application (shown as "How to Use House Mates"), viewing and editing their profile (shown as "View Profile"), and listing and removing other users from their list of potential roommates (shown as "View Your Crew").

## Viewing Profile

Users may view and edit their own profile in the "View Profile" option. This page displays the following components inputted by the user: their full name, class standing, contact information (email and/or phone number), places they would like to live, a description for them to include any other information about themselves, and an option to Edit these fields.


## Searching for Other Users

House Mates also allows registered users to search through other registered users for potential roommates. The search system can list users that satisfy criteria entered by the user, such as the first name, last name, class standing, or preferred destinations:



If a user no longer wishes to be connected to another user, they may also remove a user from their list of Housemates. This option is provided by a button in each profile on the ListHousemates page.

My role in our team was creating the user interface for the application. We decided as a group as to what features to have on the profile pages such as first and last name, contact info, desired destination, student grade level, and description. Since our application used a template, I also had to change up each profile was presented to the user. My other role was redirecting each page to make the user interface more simple.
