summary: My team and I built a web application to assist college students in finding housing outside of campus.
---

[Housemates](https://github.com/housemates/housemates) is a Meteor application that provides the University of Hawaii community with a means to collaborate on finding off-campus housing. Users will be able sign up for an account which will then allow them to find other users that want to live in the same area as they do. This assists students who want to find housing outside of campus. When looking for future housemates, the user can filter their search by name, certain area to live, and user description. If you see someone who looks like a reasonable roommate, they can contact them through any of their contact info. 

Here is a walkthrough of the application page by page.

## Landing Page

The landing page is what users are first greeted to when the enter the application. It inclused the navigation bar that inlcudes a tutorial on how to get started and the option to sign up or sign in.

## Searching for Other Users

Housemates also allows registered users to search through other registered users for potential roommates. The search system can list users that satisfy criteria entered by the user, such as the first name, last name, class standing, or preferred destinations:

If a user no longer wishes to be connected to another user, they may also remove a user from their list of Housemates. This option is provided by a button in each profile on the ListHousemates page.

## My Contribution
My role in our team was creating the user interface for the application. We decided as a group as to what features to have on the profile pages such as first and last name, contact info, desired destination, student grade level, and description. Since our application used a template, I also had to change up each profile was presented to the user. My other role was redirecting each page to make the user interface more simple.
