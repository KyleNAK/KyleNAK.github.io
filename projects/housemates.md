summary: My team and I built a web application to assist college students in finding housing outside of campus.

[Housemates](https://github.com/housemates/housemates) is a Meteor application that provides the University of Hawaii community with a means to collaborate on finding off-campus housing. Users will be able sign up for an account which will then allow them to find other users that want to live in the same area as they do. This assists students who want to find housing outside of campus. When looking for future housemates, the user can filter their search by name, certain area to live, and user description. If you see someone who looks like a reasonable roommate, they can contact them through any of their contact info. 

For more information, check out our [hompage](https://housemates.github.io/). Here, you can find more information on the app as well as learning how to install the app on your local host. All source code and information can be found [here](https://github.com/housemates/housemates).

My role in our team was creating the user interface for the application. We decided as a group as to what features to have on the profile pages such as first and last name, contact info, desired destination, student grade level, and description. Since our application used a template, I also had to change up each profile was presented to the user. My other role was redirecting each page to make the user interface more simple.
