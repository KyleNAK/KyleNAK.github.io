As humans, we are imperfect beings with the thirst for knowledge. As we thrive for knowledge, it is only natural that we ask questions to fill that thirst. Asking questions is one of the many ways that people learn and improve. This essay will talk about the two different ways of asking questions: stupid and smart. I will also talk about how smart questions can apply to software engineering as well as give examples of stupid and smart questions and how their structure and meaning affect the answers given. I will end the essay with my own insights on learning about the type of ways to ask questions.
